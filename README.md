## What is this?
This is an hello-world example to demonstrate how to integrate pantsbuild + python + django + wsgi runner.

[Pants](http://pantsbuild.github.io/) is a build system for software projects in a variety of languages. It works particularly well for a source code repository that contains many distinct projects.

.pex is generated by [PEX](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex), it is a type of Python EXecutable file which is executable Python environments in the spirit of virtualenvs.

## Steps:
    
    # Install dependencies for running uwsgi
    pip install pex uwsgi
    # Build
    ./pants binary   examples/src/python/djangoHelloMain
    # Run
    uwsgi --http :8080 -p4 --import examples/src/python/djangoHelloMain/bootstrap.py --env UWSGI_PEX=dist/djangoHelloMain.pex --module 'djangoHello.wsgi'


## Some thoughts:
1. Django project structure needs to be tailored for Pants.
2. uwsgi needs a bootstrap in order to load the module from Pex.
